This project is a digital implementation of the classic card game "Set." The Set Game is a pattern recognition card game where the goal is to 
identify "sets" of three cards that are either all the same or all different in four attributes: number, symbol, shading, and color. 
This project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to play the game on your computer.

## Rules of the Game

1. Objective: Identify a set of three cards where each attribute (number, symbol, shading, and color) is either all the same on each card or all different on each card.
2. Attributes:
    - Number: 1, 2, or 3 symbols.
    - Symbol: Diamond, Squiggle, or Oval.
    - Shading: Solid, Striped, or Open.
    - Color: Red, Green, or Purple.
3. Gameplay:
    - A deck of 81 unique cards is shuffled.
    - Twelve cards are laid out face-up on the table.
    - Players search for sets of three cards.
    - If a set is found, it is removed from the table, and three new cards are drawn.
    - The game continues until no more sets can be found or the deck is exhausted.
